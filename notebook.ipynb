Save this ratio in a column named \"leverage_ratio\" in a DataFrame called df_ratios.\n","\n","A gross margin ratio or an operating margin ratio. Save this ratio in a column named \"profitability_ratio\", in a DataFrame called df_ratios.\n","\n","The datasets provided to you have information on the type of industry a company belongs to in a column called comp_type. Your manager also needs you to answer these three questions:\n","\n","Which company type (comp_type) has the lowest profitability ratio? Save this comp_type value as a string in a variable called lowest_profitability.\n","\n","Which company type has the highest leverage ratio? Save this comp_type value as a string in a variable called highest_leverage.\n","\n","What is the relationship between leverage and profitability in the real estate companies represented in this data? Is it \"positive,\" \"negative,\" or \"no relationship?\" Save one of these three strings in a variable called relationship.\n","\n","You have two datasets at your disposal: `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` and `Income_Statement.xlsx`. Both these datasets have three columns in common:\n","- `\"Company\"`: The company's ticker name.\n","- `\"comp_type\"` The type of industry the company in question belongs to. It is either `\"tech\"` for companies in the technology industry, `\"fmcg\"` for companies in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, and `\"real_est\"` for companies in the real estate industry. \n","- `\"Year\"`: The year the company's information is from.\n","\n","The rest of the columns in the datasets contain information from the financial statement of the `\"Company\"` in question. Note that the columns in `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` only contain financial information from the balance sheet. Similarly, the columns in `Income_Statement.xlsx` only contain financial information from the income statement. The columns are named accordingly. For instance, the column `\"Total Liab\"` from `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` is the total liability."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":85,"id":"55d2a777-02c9-4448-8ecf-bff17c2e2aa1","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":13,"lastExecutedAt":1720005777088,"lastExecutedByKernel":"0ae75af0-65aa-4787-9967-819fe962edfe","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":211,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# import necessary libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":86,"id":"70f533d5-82f6-4fce-b4f1-94e0997d4c25","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":72,"lastExecutedAt":1720005777160,"lastExecutedByKernel":"0ae75af0-65aa-4787-9967-819fe962edfe","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# read the excel sheets as data frams \nBalance_sheet= pd.read_excel('data/Balance_Sheet.xlsx')\nIncome_Statement = pd.read_excel('data/Income_Statement.xlsx')","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":211,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# read the excel sheets as data frams \n","Balance_sheet= pd.read_excel('data/Balance_Sheet.xlsx')\n","Income_Statement = pd.read_excel('data/Income_Statement.xlsx')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":87,"id":"31fca39c-22e0-492b-a2cc-aa0d58ad15e9","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":55,"lastExecutedAt":1720005777217,"lastExecutedByKernel":"0ae75af0-65aa-4787-9967-819fe962edfe","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# merge the data frams of Balance sheets and Income Statements for calculating the financial ratios\nWhole_DF=pd.merge(Balance_sheet,Income_Statement, on=['Year','company'])\nprint(Whole_DF.columns)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":164,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Index(['Unnamed: 0_x', 'Year', 'comp_type_x', 'company', 'Accounts Payable',\n","       'Cash', 'Inventory', 'Property Plant Equipment',\n","       'Short Term Investments', 'Total Assets', 'Total Current Assets',\n","       'Total Current Liabilities', 'Total Liab', 'Total Stockholder Equity',\n","       'Unnamed: 0_y', 'comp_type_y', 'Cost Of Goods Sold', 'Gross Profit',\n","       'Operating Income', 'Total Operating Expenses', 'Total Revenue'],\n","      dtype='object')\n"]}],"source":["# merge the data frams of Balance sheets and Income Statements for calculating the financial ratios\n","Whole_DF=pd.merge(Balance_sheet,Income_Statement, on=['Year','company'])\n","print(Whole_DF.columns)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":88,"id":"c7e57f0b-7cbd-4e3b-b0df-ef3b8959659c","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"lastExecutedAt":1720005777269,"lastExecutedByKernel":"0ae75af0-65aa-4787-9967-819fe962edfe","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# calculat the ratios\ndf_ratios = pd.DataFrame()\ndf_ratios[['Year','compt_type_x','company']] = Whole_DF[['Year','comp_type_x','company']]\ndf_ratios['leverage_ratio'] = Whole_DF['Total Liab'] / Whole_DF['Total Stockholder Equity']\ndf_ratios['profitability_ratio'] = (Whole_DF['Total Revenue'] -
